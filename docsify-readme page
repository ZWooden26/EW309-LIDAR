# Package Description
The following package connects to the mobile robot via a ros bridge to receive odometry and lidar data. Using the data we are able to map the robotâ€™s orientation and the location of objects around the robot on a occupancy grid. This occupancy grid is published on a website which shows the grid as a map. This map shows when nothing is detected, something is detected, or if an area is unknown with colors white, black and red respectively.
